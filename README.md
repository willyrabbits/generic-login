This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the project

Here you'll find and easy authenitfication for website, made with firebase.

Auth only would be available for google/facebook users (99% of the people).

You'll need to configure your firebase app. [DOCS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup?authuser=0).

Last but not least, we are saving the users in the database as well (apart from the auth thing), so keep that in mind when stting up firebase, or feel free to remove this from the code. Should not be a big deal.

Hope you like it :)
